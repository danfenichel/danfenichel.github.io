            <p>Hello world! My name is Dan and I am an aspiring web developer. I was born and raised in the Boston area and just recently moved to Austin in early 2019. I did my undergrad at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where I studied Accounting and Finance. After working for a hedge fund for the past four years I am taking this big move across the country as an opportunity to make a major career move as well!</p>
            <br>
            <p>On top of exploring this new and exciting city I have been challenging myself with this brand new world of coding. I couldn't be more excited to continue my journey into this dynamic field and see where this new adventure takes me!</p>
